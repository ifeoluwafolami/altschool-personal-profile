                <h1>Talk about yourself</h1>
                <p>I'm Hephzibah Ifeoluwa Folami, an AltSchool student in the Cloud Engineering track. I love consuming copious amounts of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">coffee</span> tea and I love exploring new technologies. When I'm not learning to code, you'll find me hanging out with friends or working on personal projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
